# MovieLists

Done as an interview-application project for SoCreate.

An angular web application to create movie lists and search + add movies to your lists. It uses OMDB for the movie source and mainly bootstrap for designing the layout. There is also user-authentication. It uses a MySQL Database to hold information for each user and a backend that uses ASP.NET Web Core in C# which enables a REST API.
